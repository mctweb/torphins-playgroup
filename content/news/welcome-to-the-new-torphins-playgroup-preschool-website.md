  As you’ve seen throughout the site, we are a friendly, welcoming childcare
  setting based in Torphins, Aberdeenshire, and we welcome children from the age
  of two years old until they start P1. We are a registered charity (SC008749)
  run by the local community to provide high-quality, affordable childcare and
  opportunities for children to learn, explore and flourish through play.\r

  The Playgroup team and the parent committee usually host events throughout
  the year such as messy play, open mornings, and every year we host a stand at
  the local Torphins Gala, so we hope that we will see you at one of them soon!
  Keep an eye on this page for announcements and upcoming events.\r

  Our next event is this weekend to celebrate the Torphins Platinum Jubilee
  gala. We will have crafts, games and bakes for sale – see the next post for
  details!\r

  Normally at this point, we’d encourage you to visit our Facebook page for
  news and updates, but unfortunately, our Facebook page was hacked this week.
  So, this brand new site will be the main public source of information until
  further notice.\r

  If you have any queries about Playgroup, please don’t hesitate to contact
  the setting on enquiry@torphinsplaygroup.co.uk and one of the brilliant team
  members will be happy to help."
