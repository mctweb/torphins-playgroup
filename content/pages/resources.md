    body: "## Realising the Ambition: Being Me\ 

      [**Realising the
      Ambition**](https://education.gov.scot/media/3bjpr3wa/realisingtheambitio\
      n.pdf) builds on the original guidance Building the Ambition and Pre-Birth
      to Three, that our babies and children deserve the very best experiences
      throughout their learning journey; before birth and beyond. The guidance
      covers the period from birth through early childhood into primary
      education. It aspires to support practitioners in delivering what babies
      and young children need to give children the best start in life and for
      sector practice that reflects the principles of nurture, and the
      importance of relationships.\r

      For older children we will also be guided by [**Curriculum for
      Excellence: Early Level Scottish
      Government**](https://education.gov.scot/education-scotland/scottish-educ\
      ation-system/policy-for-scottish-education/policy-drivers/cfe-building-fr\
      om-the-statement-appendix-incl-btc1-5/what-is-curriculum-for-excellence)
      which builds on the solid foundations developed in the critical years
      pre-birth to three.   Our aim is to nurture each child's capacity to
      become a successful learner, confident individual, responsible citizen and
      effective contributor.  Curriculum content will be within the broad
      curriculum areas of:\r

      •\tHealth and wellbeing\r

      •\tLanguages\r

      •\tMathematics\r

      •\tSocial studies\r

      •\tExpressive arts\r
