      A day at Playgroup is a happy day! Your children will have the run of the
      indoor and outdoor spaces, where they can explore, learn, and develop
      through play.

      The day begins with a welcome song that includes each child in turn, then the play really begins – we only stop for [snacks and lunch.](/about#Lunch%20&%20Snacks)

      At Torphins Playgroup Pre-School , we aim to be flexible and responsive to our children’s needs. We recognise how important it is for children to be given time to play to follow their own line of enquiry or individual interest. Through play, children can learn to answer their own questions, practice and learn new skills and learn to work collaboratively with other children or adults. When playing, children try out ideas and come to a better understanding of thoughts and concepts.  Play also helps children cope with reality through using their imagination.

    title: Messy Play
    body: Indoors and outdoors, there is always something for the children to get
      their hands into and explore. Fill a bucket, stretch out the spaghetti,
      sift the sand, messy play involves all their senses and supports their
      progress in many different ways. Messy play can improve their fine motor
      skills, encourage them to be creative, develop their coordination, hone
      their social skills and help build their confidence. When it’s time for
      messy play, the kids dive right in!

    body: At Torphins Playgroup Preschool, there is always a role play area on the
      go – sometimes it’s the home corner, sometimes a shop or a garage,
      sometimes a bus or a fire station, it’s even been an airport! Whatever it
      is, our children know that when the doors open at the start of the day,
      it’s time to get lost in the play.
