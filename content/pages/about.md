      Founded in 1973 by a group of committed, enthusiastic parents, Torphins
      Playgroup Preschool provides a safe, unique early years learning
      environment in Aberdeenshire for children from the age of two until they
      attend primary school.

      Torphins Playgroup Preschool is committed to child-led learning through play. We follow the Scottish National Curriculums, the Curriculum for Excellence, the Pre-birth to Three Curriculum, Realising The Ambition: Being Me, as well as the Getting It Right For Every Child (GIRFEC) framework, and were awarded a score of ‘4 – Good’ at our most recent [Care Inspectorate inspection](https://www.careinspectorate.com/index.php/care-services?detail=CS2003002532)

      Parents are integral to Playgroup - running the charity as a committee, leading the playgroup in everything from hiring staff to policy making, and volunteering in the setting itself. The Committee fundraises from a wide variety of sources including grants, trusts and foundations [as well as public events and online appeals](/support-us). As well as this, parents are involved as volunteers, taking part in parent duties in the setting itself. This is a unique opportunity to really see how your children learn and take a role in their early years’ education. 

      No other childcare facility in our local area provides this combination of benefits. We are a genuine preschool that gives children the freedom to learn and experience the world through play in a caring, safe environment, guiding them while they develop through the early years curriculum, all with the close involvement of their care-givers and families.
