      - body: Yes. The team works closely with the local authority, Health Visitors and
          health professionals (such as educational psychologists and speech and
          language therapists)  to ensure that we meet the needs of all children
          at our inclusive Playgroup.  We want your child to have every
          opportunity to learn and develop towards their personal milestones,
          with the correct support in place.
        title: My child has additional support needs, can they come to your Playgroup?
      - body: >-
          The main difference between a private nursery and a playgroup
          preschool is that a private nursery opens for longer hours for much of
          the year, including holidays. As a partner setting to the
          Aberdeenshire local authority, Torphins Playgroup Preschool offers
          1140 hours per year. We are  open term time  from 9am to 3pm to
          reflect the routine of a normal school day.

          A school nursery will offer the same curriculum and standard of learning as Torphins Playgroup Preschool, but their setting is usually physically based within the school grounds which gives a close link with the school atmosphere and routines. School nursery settings usually take children from the age of 3 years old.

          A  traditional Playgroup setting is a free-flowing play and care setting, usually not linked to the national curriculum or Care Inspectorate. Sometimes, parents are required to stay.

          Torphins Playgroup Preschool is different – we have the free-play aspect of a playgroup, and we weave the curriculum through everything we do using a child-led, play based approach. We are regulated by the Care Inspectorate and have children with us from the age of 2, supporting their learning and development all the way to preparing them for transitioning into P1. We provide an alternative setting for parents looking for places at school nurseries or in private nursery preschools.
        title: What’s the difference between a nursery and a playgroup / preschool like
          Torphins Playgroup?
      - body: "At Torphins Playgroup Preschool, we understand every child is different.
          We are a child-led setting and work to the pace of your child. We
          settle each child in individually, so this will be discussed with you
          to decide everything from when your child will begin the settling in
          period to how many days? and for how long your child will attend in
          this crucial period. An e mail will be sent to confirm all
          information, and your child will be allocated a key worker from the
          staff team who will be responsible for making sure your child has a
          safe, happy and comfortable time at Playgroup.\r\n"
        title: How will you help my child settle in?
      - body: "Most days, the children are delighted to arrive at Playgroup, but every
          child will have days when they feel unsure or upset. If they are
          coming into Playgroup, one of the staff team will dedicate time to
          comfort and play with your little one, giving them opportunities to
          get involved with activities or play with toys, or just to sit quietly
          and read a story to get them back into the mood to play and enjoy
          their session with us.\r

          At Playgroup, we know and respect that you know your child
          best. If they continue to be upset after you leave, we will contact
          you when it’s appropriate and consult with you to see if there is
          something else we could be doing to help your child settle into their
          day.\r\n"
        title: What if my child is upset after I leave?
      - body: Torphins Playgroup Preschool’s policy on Infection Control is available in
          our [policies area](/resources). We ensure that this is kept up to
          date with all current Scottish Government  guidelines.
        title: What Covid-19 precautions are in place?
      - body: "Torphins Playgroup is a Local Authority Partner Organisation and as such,
          we follow the terms and holiday periods of our local school, Torphins
          Primary School. For details of Aberdeenshire Council term dates visit
          https://aberdeenshire.gov.uk/schools/school-info/school-term-dates "
        title: Are you open in the school holidays?
      - body: Yes – we take children from across Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen. Provided
          that you are able to bring your child to the setting and have
          arrangements in place in case your child requires to be picked up (in
          case of illness or other emergency) we are happy to receive your
          application for a place.
        title: I don’t live in Torphins, can my child still come to Torphins Playgroup
          Preschool?
      - body: Lunch is available – this is free for children with Eligible 2 places or a
          funded place under the Scottish Government 1140 Hours scheme. For more
          information about [lunches or to read our Healthy Eating
          statement](/about#lunch-&-snacks)
        title: Is lunch provided?
      - body: "We accept children from the age of 2 years old, but every child is
          different. We offer half day and full day sessions and spend as much
          time as they need settling them in, but you know best what your child
          is ready for. Why not arrange a visit to our setting and talk more
          with our friendly, experienced team? [Contact Us To Arrange A
          Visit](#contact)\r

          At Playgroup your child will have opportunities to explore
          and learn at their own pace, developing skills and independence in a
          safe, caring, happy environment.\r

          Please note that we do not require that your child is potty
          trained when they start attending Playgroup.\r\n"
        title: How will I know if my child is ready to come to Torphins Playgroup
          Preschool?
      - body: "Our staff team is enthusiastic, hardworking and dedicated; all members of
          the team either hold or are working towards national qualifications in
          Early Years Education.\r

          Every member of the staff team holds membership of the
          Scottish PVG scheme. For more details of the scheme visit
          [mygov.scot](https://www.mygov.scot/pvg-scheme)\r\n"
        title: Are all of the staff at Torphins Playgroup Preschool qualified?
      - body: "At Torphins Playgroup Preschool, we follow the [Curriculum for
          Excellence](https://education.gov.scot/documents/All-experiencesoutco\
          mes18.pdf), [Pre-Birth to
          Three](https://www.stirling.gov.uk/media/1389/elc2_prebirthtothreeboo\
          klet.pdf), [Realising The Ambition: Being
          Me](https://education.gov.scot/media/3bjpr3wa/realisingtheambition.pd\
          f), and [Getting It Right For Every Child
          (GIRFEC)](https://www.gov.scot/policies/girfec/) to support children
          as they grow and develop in their learning.\r

          Our principal ethos is that children learn through play, and
          everything we do revolves around this concept. Learning should be fun!
          \r

          However, there is a little more to it behind the scenes! The
          purpose of a curriculum at this early stage is to support children in
          all aspects of their emotional, social, cognitive and physical
          development. It should enable them to become increasingly independent,
          responsible and eager to progress in their learning. Staff in
          preschool education achieve this through their skilled interaction
          with each child and by providing stimulating contexts for active
          learning, building upon the child’s knowledge and skills and
          recognising his or her stage of development. They can build upon
          children’s enthusiasm, inventiveness and creativity to plan learning
          activities which combine to achieve this purpose.\r\n"
        title: What curriculum do you follow?
      - body: We consider the Playgroup garden as one of our most valuable resources and
          regard outdoor activities as a natural enhancement and extension of
          our indoor environment. We offer free flow play meaning your child can
          choose whether they would like to play inside or outside during their
          session. We encourage the children to commence their day outside.
          Children can access, paints, puzzles and books outside as well as the
          physical equipment, such as bikes and swings. We believe that outdoor
          play has just as much to offer the children as our indoor environment.
        title: How much time do you spend outside?
      - body: "##### What is play?

          Free play is what happens when children and young people
          follow their own ideas and interests in their own way, and for their
          own reasons. They can do this on their own or with others. It can
          happen inside or outside. Children and young people should be given
          the choice of how and when they play.\ 


          ##### The importance of play\r

          When we talk about play, people naturally think about young
          children, however all children and young people should have the
          opportunity to play every day.\r

          Play is important for the early stages of brain development
          and playing with your child can help build relationships for later
          life. But no matter what age we are, play helps to develop important
          skills for learning, life and work.\r

          Encouraging play is one of the best things you can do for
          your child, whatever their age.\r


          ##### Learning Through Play \r

          Through play, children can learn to answer their own
          questions, practice and learn new skills and learn to work
          collaboratively with other children or adults. When playing, children
          try out ideas and come to a better understanding of thoughts and
          concepts.  Play also helps children cope with reality through using
          their imagination. [Click here to view The Scottish Government’s
          national strategy for
          play](https://www.gov.scot/resource/0042/00425722.pdf)  \r\n"
        title: What is ‘Learning through Play’?
      - body: "At Playgroup we are out in the garden as much as possible, experimenting
          and exploring. During the summer months we ask parents and carers to
          apply sunscreen to their child before they come to Playgroup. If your
          child is with us for a full day session, we can reapply  sunscreen
          from a bottle that you provide to us (please note that this is one of
          the things that we require written consent for in the child’s care
          plan – this will be discussed in more detail closer to your child’s
          start date). \r

          In the winter months we take advice on closure from
          Aberdeenshire Council. If Torphins Primary School closes due to the
          weather, then Playgroup will be closed too.  Parents and Carers will
          receive a call from a member of the Playgroup staff or committee if we
          close during a session. Outwith Playgroup opening hours,
          parents/carers will be notified via e mail and our Facebook
          page.  \r\n"
        title: "What happens if it snows or is very sunny? "
      - body: "Children and parents are entitled to expect the highest quality in
          childcare practice. Observing is an essential element in achieving
          quality childcare practice because it helps us to ‘know’ the children
          in our care. It leads to an understanding of the children’s
          developmental needs and helps us to plan appropriately. \r

          We use [Learning Journals](https://learningjournals.co.uk/)
          to record your child’s journey at playgroup. This is linked to
          different curricular areas where we can track how your child is
          progressing. Parents will receive an email to connect to their child’s
          Learning Journal once the child commences. Parents and children can
          take ownership of these journals and can freely add observations and
          stories from home learning and experiences.\r

          Throughout your child’s time with us we will give you
          regular verbal feedback on their progress,  offering parent
          consultations termly. During your child’s time at Playgroup, we also
          take several photographs to show the children’s progression as well as
          for quality assurance. \r\n"
        title: How will I know what my child has been doing in the sessions?
      - title: How can I be sure that my child is safe while they are at Playgroup
        body: "Playgroup has a library of policies and procedures that staff, the
          committee, and parents are required to read on a regular basis. These
          policies are formally reviewed and updates in line with Scottish
          Government guidance.\
